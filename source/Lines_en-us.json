                "I mean, it's the Literature Club. We talk about that stuff together, right?",
                "And the only way to get more comfortable with it is to suck it up and do it.",
                "Oh...",
                "You're...not wrong. I'm sorry for being resistant.",
                "It's not good to say suck it up because it sounds like their feelings don't matter.",
                "Right...my bad. It's just a habit I need to break.",
                "Well anyway, who's gonna start?",
                "I'll start!",
                "I was the first to join, after all.",
                "Ahaha. Wouldn't that be me?",
                "No! I wanna go first!",
                "Fine, fine. You can start, I don't mind.",
                "Yay!",
                "So...",
                "Gosh, it feels like so long ago. I think I joined because I wanted to have fun sharing poems with people.",
                "It seemed like it would be a safe way to express myself...you know, like if it's just a poem, then I can share it without feeling like I'm burdening everyone with my problems.",
                "And I thought it would be a really good way to get to know other people, too.",
                "So yeah, I was really surprised when I walked in and it was just Monika!",
                "And she was sleeping!",
                "Ahaha, don't remind me of that! Oh gosh...",
                "Yeah, but it seemed like so much fun to help start a new club.",
                "Especially since writing helped me so much, I wanted to see it help other people too.",
                "...But it ended up being me who was inspired. 'Cause I remember feeling like Monika was just so sweet and mature, and that I could trust her with anything.",
                "It made me feel a lot less alone, having someone who knew even the bad things about me.",
                "And at that point I knew the Literature Club was gonna be special for a lot of people.",
                "Yeah, I felt the same way.",
                "It really helped give the club a more cohesive vision.",
                "Yeah, and then Yuri joined, but she was so different from us. And Natsuki, too.",
                "I think...for Yuri, it really helped for me to take the lead before she was able to open up a little.",
                "But Natsuki was kind of the opposite, where she wasn't ready to get really close to someone really quickly. I never really thought about that sort of thing.",
                "I really feel like I've gotten better at understanding people's different needs.",
                "And that makes me really happy. Because my friends are just the most important thing to me.",
                "And whatever new members we get, I want to help them in those ways too.",
                "I don't know if I would have continued coming to the club, if it weren't for you.",
                "Really?",
                "Mhm.",
                "I know it wasn't too long ago, but it hurts to think about my behavior back then...",
                "I was really short-sighted.",
                "The only reason I came was to find others who were into fantasy. I suppose that was my idea of making friends with people.",
                "And I remember feeling uncomfortable because you and I have...such different energy.",
                "I had such a specific idea of the kind of person I could be friends with. So when Sayori tried so hard to get to know me, I felt like I was just wasting her time.",
                "I think...I was naive to assume that similar interests were the key component of friendship.",
                "Sayori and I were able to be friends because she always thinks about the needs of other people. That's something I never knew how to do...or even thought to do.",
                "But I stayed in the club, thanks to that. And I started trying as hard as I could to understand people better.",
                "You really went above and beyond when it came to that. I was just super impressed.",
                "Well, I always hated that I didn't know how to behave like a person who is easily liked by others...like the two of you can.",
                "And because of that, I spent so much time thinking about my own behavior, and all the wrong things I said.",
                "But the whole time, I should have been thinking about other people instead. Not myself.",
                "Once I started doing that, I was able to make friends with...everyone else.",
                "Oh, also...I discovered that sometimes I'm a better communicator when I take the time to write, rather than speak.",
                "It's so strange the way things turned out. It's so far different from anything I ever would have expected.",
                "But...I'm happy.",
                "I suppose we don't always know what we really need.",
                "Oh my gosh.",
                "You're so cute that I'm going to throw up.",
                "Okay, please don't do that, Sayori.",
                "Besides, I'm not...cute.",
                "Hey, isn't that my line?",
                "Oh...",
                "Well, for me, it's actually true, so...",
                "W-What are you saying??",
                "Nothing!",
                "I finished my part, so somebody else take their turn!",
                "My heart--",
                "Sayori, take some deep breaths...",
                "Okay fine, I'll go.",
                "Yuri, I can't believe you were complaining about doing this and still went before me. What a show-off.",
                "I was just--following up on Sayori! It was the easiest way to get it over with.",
                "Besides, you left out the most important thing that you get out of this club!",
                "I did...?",
                "Yeah. A regular supply of your favorite cupcakes.",
                "Oh no! I forgot that too!",
                "I'm a traitor to the cupcake queen...",
                "Neither of you are forgiven.",
                "Looks like only Monika will be getting cupcakes next time.",
                "Noooooo!!",
                "I can't eat that many cupcakes!",
                "Yeah...true. Only Yuri can.",
                "Hey!",
                "Ahaha! Well, anyway...I'm just putting off talking.",
                "It's kinda hard to talk about this stuff.",
                "But I guess what it comes down to is that I'm...in a much better place mentally than I was when I first joined.",
                "And that's because everyone helped me realize that I had some really toxic friendships going on outside the club.",
                "It was honestly a really painful thing to go through. Having to cut them out. It still hurts to think about.",
                "I'm sorry, Natsuki...",
                "It's fine. I knew it was for the best. And I was right.",
                "I guess for me it's all about feelings.",
                "I was only ever ridiculed for having feelings, so I thought the right thing to do was to just ignore them.",
                "It took me a really long time to realize that it's not really how things are supposed to work.",
                "And I guess that's thanks to everyone who took the time to respect my feelings, even when I was being like, the biggest jerk.",
                "I'm really sorry for being such a jerk to everyone.",
                "I was really the worst--",
                "Natsuki's voice chokes a little.",
                "We love you, Natsuki...",
                "I just--hate that I was like that.",
                "Everyone did so much for me, and I could never do anything in return.",
                "That's not true!",
                "Natsuki...",
                "You've done a lot more than you think.",
                "This club really wouldn't have been the same without you. I mean that.",
                "...",
                "Remember how judgmental I was when you first showed up?",
                "It was like I couldn't accept anything other than my own idea of what a literature club was supposed to be.",
                "Apparently, that was more important to me than the opportunity to bring you some happiness.",
                "You really taught me that anything that makes someone happy is worthy of respect.",
                "You even inspired me to start playing piano. That's something that means a whole lot to me.",
                "So there's no need to put yourself down.",
                "...Okay...",
                "Natsuki wipes her eyes.",
                "You helped me a lot too!",
                "It's so much fun to have you around.",
                "And you helped me become a better person.",
                "Having a problem doesn't make you needy or inconvenient.",
                "It means that there's something that needs to be better for you. And you always deserve that.",
                "...I agree.",
                "Seeing us have some of the same struggles...made me a better person as well.",
                "I wouldn't want to change anything about our time here.",
                "I don't think any of us would.",
                "I'm sorry I got all dramatic again.",
                "That's all I wanted to say, so Monika can go now.",
                "There's no need to apologize.",
                "It was something I wanted to talk about, anyway, because it made a big difference for me.",
                "I was always such a strict perfectionist who never took enough time to believe in the best of other people.",
                "But everyone kept proving me wrong. I made the mistake multiple times thinking that my way was the best for everyone.",
                "Or thinking that I was needed to solve other people's problems.",
                "But I think being a leader means that you have to acknowledge that you're not perfect, and that the best thing you can do is to help guide people, rather than to do everything for them.",
                "We're all good people. We're all equals.",
                "I think that's the most important thing I've gotten out of the club. Realizing what that really means.",
                "...Sayori, what are you doing?",
                "I just thought that we should be writing some of these things down.",
                "Things about the club that are valuable to us.",
                "With a piece of chalk in her hand, Sayori writes the word \"Trust\" on the chalkboard.",
                "This is because you showed me that I could trust you with everything about me. Not just my good side.",
                "Suddenly, Yuri takes a piece of chalk as well.",
                "She writes \"Understanding\".",
                "I...I owe a lot of gratitude to everyone who took the time to understand me, even though it was so difficult for me to express myself.",
                "Hmm, in that case...",
                "Monika takes a piece of chalk as well, and writes the word \"Respect\".",
                "I always thought I was a respectful person, but it took the club for me to realize that there was more to it than I thought. And I'm a better person because of it.",
                "I have another one!",
                "Sayori writes \"Balance\".",
                "Sometimes people want different things out of a friendship, or they need time before they're ready to become close.",
                "So it's important to keep things balanced between you and the other person.",
                "That reminds me...",
                "Yuri writes \"Reflection\".",
                "I've always been a reflective person, but...most of it has been nothing more than hating myself for all the things I thought I did wrong.",
                "Once I started reflecting on other people, and not just myself, a lot of things changed for me.",
                "So I think that's the most important one for me.",
                "That's great. We have a whole list of things now.",
                "Suddenly, everyone turns to look at Natsuki.",
                "...Well, everyone took all the chalk! Don't look at me like that, jeez!",
                "You could have just asked.",
                "Monika hands her piece of chalk to Natsuki.",
                "Then, Natsuki sighs and writes \"Self-Love\".",
                "I don't know how far I've gotten with it yet, but...",
                "It feels like things are at least on the right track.",
                "So there, that's my contribution.",
                "Together, everyone stares at the words on the board.",
                "Wasn't this club supposed to be about literature...?",
                "It is! We still do a lot of literature!",
                "Friendship and literature.",
                "Yeah...you're right.",
                "Friendship and literature.",
                "Natsuki and Yuri gently nod as well.",
                "...Hey, let's all take a picture together!",
                "We don't have one yet, right?",
                "Hey, you're right!",
                "Make sure you send it to me after!",
                "Wait, can I...brush my hair first, or something?",
                "Oh, you're fine. You already have the best hair out of all of us.",
                "Mm...",
                "Everyone get together, I can't fit you all in.",
                "Okay...",
                "Okay, everyone ready?",
                "Aaaand...click!",
                "I'm really glad we talked about this stuff.",
                "It's easy to forget how far we've come, with only four members.",
                "Yeah!",
                "I have so many happy thoughts right now.",
                "I'm getting some really good inspiration for a poem...",
                "You know, I feel the same way. I kinda want to get some writing done.",
                "Me too!",
                "I think...I would like that as well.",
                "...Everyone's looking at me again!",
                "I'll do it too, but I might not feel like sharing it.",
                "That's okay.",
                "The four members of the Literature Club disperse and return to their desks, each equipping themselves with a pen.",
                "Natsuki and Yuri give each other a quick glance, then start writing immediately.",
                "Sayori stretches, then does the same.",
                "But Monika is left tapping her pen against the paper, unsure of where to start.",
                "...",

                "Monika mouths to herself.",
                "Write the way into your heart.",
                "Her mind full of thoughts, memories, and inspiration, Monika navigates past her mental barriers and begins to write.",

                "I should have made her feel good about being passionate about something. But I just dismissed it. No, I was actually trying to avoid acknowledging it at all.",
                "I even did that with you, Yuri! When you first joined the club!",
                "You...you did?",
                "Yeah, I remember. Fantasy isn't really my thing, so I was kind of trying to dismiss it, but then Sayori jumped in and took over the conversation.",
                "I should have reflected on that, but I didn't, because I just let Sayori handle it instead.",
                "And now, I'm repeating the same mistake, except I really hurt someone this time.",
                "Monika shakes her head.",

                "It's so stupid.",
                "Like...I can just picture how much joy it would bring Natsuki if I let her share her passion a little.",
                "I'm so angry that her friends were treating her like that. I'm going to get them back for it.",
                "Get them back...?",
                "Yeah.",
                "I'll get them back...by making sure that this is the Literature Club that Natsuki wants. Not the one that they want.",
                "Suddenly, Sayori bursts through the door, making Monika and Yuri jump.",
                "With a rare, stern face, she marches over to Monika's desk and sits down next to her.",
                "I'm having an intervention!",
                "I can do that because I'm Vice President.",
                "Is this about Natsuki?",

                "I messed up. I'm super sorry.",
                "I was just talking to Yuri about it.",
                "Really??",
                "I was so dismissive of her passion that she felt threatened, and probably just unwelcome.",
                "Literally the opposite of what the Literature Club is supposed to be.",
                "...I really need to make it up to her.",
                "Oh.",
                "...Yay, I did it!",
                "Ahaha. Thanks for the intervention, Sayori. I'm glad we're on the same page.",
                "Friendship wins again!",
                "So how do you want to make it up to her?",
                "...I have a plan.",
                "Sayori, do you know if Natsuki is coming to the club meeting today?",
                "She's...I don't think she is...",
                "I see...",
                "Monika was afraid of that. Not because of her plan, but because she's facing the consequences of the damage that she's inadvertently caused.",
                "But the only way to do the right thing is to face it head on.",
                "It's so easy to just duck away from conflict and wait for it to blow over.",
                "But that's not enough.",
                "To truly respect someone's feelings after you've hurt them is to face them and admit your wrongdoing.",
                "Not the wrongdoing of mismanaging the club--but the wrongdoing of disrespecting Natsuki's feelings.",
                "Okay. Do you think you can get her to come to the meeting tomorrow?",
                "I can do that!",
                "Okay, awesome.",
                "Yuri, you don't have to worry about anything, but thank you for being my friend. You're a good listener.",
                "Mm...",
                "Fidgeting with her hair, Yuri turns away to hide a smile.",
                "Well, I guess for today, it's going to be a pretty quiet club meeting.",
                "I'm going to step out for a bit, is that okay?",
                "Yeah, I'm just gonna read with Yuri!",
                "Hey, is this one of Natsuki's books? How come it's out here?",
                "Sayori picks up a manga that was resting on an adjacent desk.",
                "Oh... That? Um, Natsuki probably just left it out by accident...",
                "But I thought she hasn't been coming to the club...?",
                "Actually, Monika's been--",
                "Okay, Yuri, I'm sure it was just someone else who was using this classroom, then. Okay?",
                "...",
                "Monika smiles at them both.",
                "Then, with a wave, she exits the clubroom.",
                "I really shouldn't have left that out...",
                "If Sayori catches on, she'll definitely tell Natsuki, and that would get really awkward...",
                "Now...I wonder if there's a keyboard I could borrow from the music room?"

                "I always felt like I should only share the absolute best parts of myself, the parts that will impress people or make them like me more.",
                "But after you joined the club, I really realized how self-destructive that mentality is.",
                "We share things because we want to express ourselves. Sharing experiences allows us to share emotions.",
                "And I just felt like...like I wanted to show you this, because if it wasn't for you, I never would have started playing.",
                "Ahaha. Hey, I think the credit for that one goes to Parfait Girls, not me.",
                "No...",
                "Well, maybe it's true that Parfait Girls put the thought into my head...",

                "I'm spending time with people who put me down whenever I don't have their approval.",
                "That's probably what's making me feel so confused.",
                "Because...I'm threatened out of the things that <i>should</i> make me happy.",
                "So no matter what, it's like I have to be unhappy to be happy.",
                "It's making my head hurt.",

                "Like...so much of you has gone into it. So much that it feels like that's just how your life is.",

                "They continue like that for a few more cycles while Yuri closely monitors.",
                "Eventually, Yuri feels Natsuki rest more of her weight into Yuri's palms.",
                "Let's focus on the physical world.",

                "By now, the worst of it has passed, but Yuri is determined not to move away until Natsuki prompts her to.",
                "Meanwhile, Natsuki has lifted her head off her knees, and her breathing has mostly steadied.",
                "Then, she takes a final deep breath and slowly pulls herself to her feet, causing Yuri to let go.",

                "Yuri turns away to pick up her open book from the dusty floor, which she had hastily set down earlier. She brushes the dust off the cover.",
                "I...don't think I could have gotten through that alone.",
                "...You're not alone.",

                "You don't have to do anything alone.",
                "As she says that, Yuri tenses up.",
                "It's rare for her to so openly share her thoughts.",
                "But something about Natsuki--of all people--makes it feel so much more natural to do so.",
                "Perhaps because like Yuri, Natsuki is so timid and uncertain of herself.",
                "Natsuki does such a good job at hiding it that it's taken a long time for Yuri to finally realize it.",
                "And because of that, Yuri is able to deliver the reassurance that she herself would have wanted.",
                "Demonstrating that you deserve the love of others.",
                "If you can accept that for the first time, then perhaps you can begin the tumultuous journey of learning to love yourself.",
                "Do you really mean that?",
                "You're probably gonna regret saying that, if you do.",
                "How so?",
                "Because.",
                "I'm probably gonna have a lot of free time during the weekends, from now on.",
                "So you're giving me permission to be as annoying as I want and drag you around to a lot of places.",
                "I see.",
                "But you already said it, so you can't take it back now.",
                "Ah...",
                "Well, I suppose I have no choice but to accept that responsibility, then.",
                "Mhm.",
                "I know a good ice cream place.",
                "Oh?",
                "That means you'll finally figure out my favorite ice cream flavor.",
                "Huh?",
                "What are you talking about?",
                "Oh, you don't remember?",
                "The first day that you came to the club...you guessed everyone's favorite ice cream flavor, but for me you said you had no idea.",
                "Seriously?",
                "I don't remember that at all.",
                "...Oh wait, yes I do. I said it was probably green tea.",
                "Yuri shakes her head.",
                "It's a good guess, but my favorite is usually to get chocolate and raspberry together.",
                "Chocolate and raspberry?",
                "How fancy.",
                "How is that fancy?",
                "Oh, I dunno.",

                "Maybe next time I'll try chocolate and strawberry.",
                "Hey, strawberry is my favorite!",
                "Hmm.",
                "What a coincidence.",

                "But I feel like we're way past that at this point...I don't even know what to talk about.",
                "Except that I think it...helped me understand my needs a little bit better.",
                "The way I like to be treated.",
                "And the kinds of friends that I want to have.",
                "That's why I wanted to start coming here in the first place. Even though I was so scared of causing more problems.",
                "I thought...I thought it was a coincidence that you ran into me here initially?",
                "Oh--Ah--",
                "Well, not...exactly...",
                "What do you mean?",
                "Nothing.",
                "I...I may have tracked you down first.",
                "With the help of Sayori.",
                "That's--",

                "I can tell that you've been making a lot of difficult decisions.",
                "It's brave. And it will make things better in the long run.",
                "I think anyone would be proud of you for it.",

                "To be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs.",
                "It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events...",
                "I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it.",

                "You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile.",
                "But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important.",

                "This club is seriously going to be the death of me...",

                "This is too sudden...!",
                "Well, if you can't recite your poem in front of the club, how do you expect to do it in front of strangers?",
                "Oh no...",
                "Don't worry.",
                "I'll start off to help everyone feel a little more comfortable.",
                "Can I go next??",
                "Ahaha. Of course.",
                "Now, let's see...",
                "Monika flips through her notebook to the specific poem she has in mind for herself.",
                "She then stands behind the podium.",
                "The title of this poem is <i>The Way They Fly</i>.",
                "Ahem...",
                "Monika begins reciting her poem.",
                "Her clear, confident voice fills the room.",
                "More than that, her inflection is pristine.",
                "She knows exactly how to apply emotion behind each line she recites, bringing the words to life.",
                "Is this something she's done before, or is she simply a natural?",
                "I glance around me.",
                "Everyone has their eyes on Monika.",
                "Sayori looks amazed.",
                "Yuri has an intense expression on her face that I don't understand.",
                "Finally, Monika finishes the recitation.",
                "The four of us applaud.",
                "Monika takes a breath and smiles.",
                "That...that was so good, Monika!",
                "Ahaha, thank you very much.",
                "I was just hoping to set a good example.",
                "Are you ready to go next, Sayori?",
                "I...I'll go next!!",
                "Uwah! Yuri's fired up all of a sudden!",
                "Yuri clutches a sheet of paper between her hands and stands up.",
                "Keeping her head down, she walks quickly over to the podium.",
                "This poem is called--!",
                "Yuri anxiously glances at each of us.",
                "You can do it, Yuri...",
                "It...It's called...<i>Afterimage of a Crimson Eye</i>.",
                "Yuri's voice shakes as she starts reading the poem.",
                "Just a moment ago, she practically refused to do this.",
                "Why is she suddenly putting in so much effort?",
                "As Yuri gets past the first couple of lines, her voice changes.",
                "It's almost like what happens when Yuri gets absorbed into her books.",
                "Her quivering words transform into the sharp syllables of a fierce and confident woman.",
                "The poem is full of twists and turns in its structure that she enunciates with perfect timing.",
                "This must be a rare glimpse into the whirling fire Yuri keeps concealed inside her head...!",
                "Suddenly, she's finished.",
                "Everyone is stunned.",
                "Yuri snaps back into reality and glances around her, as if she bewildered even herself.",
                "I...",
                "...It's up to me to save this situation.",
                "I'm the first to start applauding.",
                "Everyone joins me afterward, and we give Yuri the recognition she deserves.",
                "It's not that we didn't want to applaud for her.",
                "But we were caught so off-guard that we must have forgotten.",
                "As we applaud, Yuri holds the poem to her chest and rushes back into her seat.",
                "Yuri, that was really good.",
                "Thank you for sharing.",
                "...",
                "Looks like Yuri is down for the count...",
                "Okaay~",
                "I guess I'm next, then!",
                "Sayori hops out of her chair and cheerfully walks to the podium.",
                "This one's called...<i>My Meadow</i>.",
                "Ah...",
                "...Ahaha!",
                "Sorry, I giggled...",
                "Ehehe...",
                "Sayori...",
                "It's a lot harder than I thought!",
                "How did you guys do it so easily?",
                "Ah...",
                "Try not to think of it like you're reciting to other people.",
                "Imagine you're reciting it to yourself, like in front of a mirror, or in your own head.",
                "It's your poem, so it'll come out the best that way.",
                "I see, I see...",
                "Okay, then...",
                "Sayori begins her poem.",
                "Somehow, it feels like her soft voice was made as a perfect match.",
                "The poem isn't aimlessly cheery like Sayori is.",
                "It's serene and bittersweet.",
                "If I were to read this on paper, I probably wouldn't think much of it...",
                "But hearing it come from Sayori's voice almost gives it a whole new meaning.",
                "Maybe this is what Sayori meant when she said she likes my poems.",
                "It's like I get to reach more deeply into someone I thought I knew through and through.",
                "Sayori finishes, and we applaud.",
                "I did it~!",
                "Good job, Sayori.",
                "Ehehe, even [player] liked it.",
                "I guess that's a good sign~",
                "What does that even mean...?",
                "It came out nicely, Sayori.",
                "The atmosphere of the poem fits you really nicely.",
                "But it might be that other poems wouldn't work quite as well with that kind of delivery...",
                "Eh? I don't really understand...",
                "In other words, I've seen poems of yours where that sort of gentle delivery wouldn't work as well.",
                "They might need a little more force behind them, depending on what you're reading...",
                "Oh, I know what you mean!",
                "That's...well, I've been practicing that kind of thing...",
                "It's just embarrassing to do in front of everyone...",
                "Ehehe...",
                "Then next time, I'm going to make you pick a poem that challenges you a little more.",
                "We don't have much time before the festival, you know?",
                "Okaaaaay.",
                "Now, who's next...?",
                "Natsuki?",
                "Hmph.",
                "Don't make me go before [player].",
                "It's not like I can compare to you guys, anyway...",
                "Might as well let [player] lower everyone's standards a little before I have to do it.",
                "Natsuki...",
                "It's fine, it's fine.",
                "I might as well get it over with.",
                "But it's not like I have much of a selection of what to read...",
                "I'll just have to go with what I wrote for today.",
                "I stand up and step in front of the podium.",
                "Everyone has their eyes on me, making me feel terribly awkward.",
                "I recite my poem.",
                "Since I'm not exactly confident in my own writing, it's hard to put energy into it.",
                "Despite that, once I finish, I receive applause anyway.",
                "Sorry I'm not really as good as everyone else...",
                "Don't worry about it so much.",
                "I think it's less about your abilities, and more about your lack of confidence in your writing.",
                "That's something that'll improve over time, though.",
                "Yeah... Maybe.",
                "Alright, then!",
                "That just leaves you, Natsuki.",
                "Yeah, yeah.",
                "I'm going.",
                "Natsuki begrudgingly gets out of her seat and makes her way to the podium.",
                "The poem is called...",
                "It's called...",
                "W-Why are you all looking at me?!",
                "Because you're presenting...",
                "Hmph...",
                "Anyway...the poem is called <i>Jump</i>.",
                "Natsuki takes a breath.",
                "Once she starts reciting the poem, her sour attitude disappears a little.",
                "While she's still a little unenthused, her poem has a rhythm and rhyme to it.",
                "It's Natsuki's trademark style, and it works surprisingly well when spoken aloud.",
                "The words feel like they bounce up and down, as if giving life to the poem.",
                "Natsuki finishes, and everyone applauds.",
                "She huffs back to her seat.",
                "That wasn't so bad, was it?",
                "Easy for you to say...",
                "You'd better not make me do that again.",
                "Ah, well...",
                "Do you at least feel prepared enough to recite a poem in front of other people?",
                "I mean, doing it in front of other people will be way easier!",
                "I can put on whatever face I want for other people.",
                "But when it's just my friends...",
                "It's just...embarrassing.",
                "That's a surprise, Natsuki...",
                "I think it would be the other way around for me.",
                "Well, that's just how it is, so...",
                "Well, I guess in that case...",
                "You won't have much to worry about for the festival.",
                "That said, I want to thank everyone for coming through.",
                "It might be hard, but I hope that you all have an idea of what it's like now.",
                "Make sure you pick a poem and get enough practice before the festival, okay?",
                "I'll be making pamphlets, so let me know ahead of time what you'll be reciting.",
                "Jeez...",
                "I should probably find some other poem to recite instead.",
                "That's fine, too!",
                "It doesn't have to be your own.",
                "I'm already pleasantly surprised that you're putting in all this effort for the club.",
                "It makes me really happy.",
                "Ah... Yeah, no problem...",
                "Okay, everyone!",
                "I think that's about it for today.",
                "I know the festival is coming up, but let's try to write poems for tomorrow, as well.",
                "It's been working out really nicely so far, so I'd like to continue that.",
                "As for the festival, we'll finish planning tomorrow, and then we'll have the weekend to prepare.",
                "Monday's the big day!",
                "I can't wait~!",
                "I can do this... I can do this...",
                "Alright--",
                "I stand up.",
                "There's no way I'll be able to find the same enthusiasm as Sayori and Monika, but I'll do my best to get through it.",
                "If it's for the sake of the club...",
                "And impressing Monika...",
                "Then I'll have to do my best.",
                "Ready to go, Sayori?",

                "I grab her wrist with my hand before it reaches my face.",

                "It's so clean...",
                "Ahaha...",
                "I cleaned it before you came over, so...",
                "That's very considerate of you to do.",
                "Ah, no...",
                "I would be really embarrassed for my room to be a mess while you were here.",
                "Hmm...",
                "Well, I do enjoy cleaning...",
                "I would have gladly helped you clean.",
                "Ah--",
                "That would be even more embarrassing!",
                "Wait, don't look in there--!",
                "I snatch Yuri's wrist, which was in the process of opening a desk drawer of mine.",
                "A-Ah...",
                "I'm sorry...!",
                "I wasn't thinking for some reason...",
                "I was just spacing out!",
                "It's fine, it's fine...",
                "I let go of Yuri's wrist.",
                "She puts both of her hands firmly in her lap, as if making sure she's keeping track of them.",
                "So, um...",
                "Should we...get started?",
                "Ah...",
                "Yes...",
                "Um, I have a few things planned that you can help with...",
                "Decorations and other atmospheric enhancements.",
                "Atmospheric enhancements...?",
                "You know...",
                "Mood lighting, aromatherapy candles...",
                "Oh, wow.",
                "I didn't know you planned on taking it that far.",
                "Of course.",
                "I want to help take our guests to a faraway place.",
                "Although many will stop by just out of curiosity...",
                "And for...cupcakes, I guess...",
                "I'm determined to provide an experience that will leave them wanting more.",
                "That's great.",
                "It's easy to forget that you're a pretty intense person.",
                "Ah--",
                "Intense...?",
                "I guess that's the best way to put it.",

                "No, not at all.",
                "It's something that I like about you, actually.",
                "I-Is that so...?",
                "That makes me feel relieved...",
                "And kind of happy...",
                "Yeah, no need to be so anxious.",
                "You can relax a little.",
                "Relax...",
                "I brought some things for relaxation.",
                "I was going to use them during the poetry event...",
                "Oh yeah? Like what?",
                "Let's see...",
                "Yuri rummages through her bag.",
                "She pulls out a few candles and a wooden cylinder-shaped object.",
                "I did some shopping on the way here, so I happen to have these in my bag.",
                "I planned to cover the windows in black paper and use the candles to light the room.",
                "I think that would be amazing, don't you?",
                "Yeah, that would be really neat.",
                "What's that wooden thing, though?",
                "Oh, this?",
                "It's a diffuser for essential oils.",
                "How familiar are you with aromatherapy?",
                "Not familiar at all...",
                "Ah, is that so?",
                "It's one of my favorite contributors to a positive atmosphere.",
                "Depending on the oils or herbs you choose, you can change the mood of the air itself.",
                "You can even feel it permeate through your body.",
                "Relaxation, positive energy, romance, reflection...",
                "It's almost like magic.",
                "Yuri takes the cylinder and pushes a switch on the bottom.",
                "In just a moment, a thin ray of vapor begins to spout through a small hole on the top.",
                "Wow, that smells wonderful.",
                "What kind of mood is that one for?",
                "This is a Jasmine essential oil.",
                "It smells a little sweet and flowery, right?",
                "Yeah, that's a good way to describe it.",
                "I chose Jasmine for the event because it provides more than relaxation.",
                "Jasmine enhances your emotions and helps you feel them flow through your body.",
                "You feel warmer, and your heart pounds more heavily.",
                "Don't you think that will be perfect for sharing our poems?",
                "It does sound suitable...",
                "But you seem to know a lot about this, so I'll trust your opinion with anything.",
                "Yuri smiles gently, clearly enjoying herself.",
                "She again reaches into her bag and pulls out several spools of thin ribbon.",
                "What are those for?",
                "Well...",
                "Did you purchase the origami paper I asked you to get?",
                "Yeah, I have it over here...",
                "We won't be using the paper for folding origami.",
                "What I'd like to do is write a different word on each paper.",
                "We'll need about a hundred of them.",
                "Oh yeah?",
                "What will those be used for?",
                "Well, I'm going to cut pieces of ribbon to hang from the doorway of the classroom.",
                "Then, we can fasten the paper onto the ribbons to create a doorway curtain.",
                "Wouldn't that be beautiful?",
                "It would also catch the eye of those passing by the room...",
                "It may attract some to peek inside.",
                "That's really creative!",
                "I had no idea you'd be so good at this, Yuri.",
                "Is...that so?",
                "Well, I suppose I do get a little intense...as you'd put it.",
                "Uhuhu.",
                "Yuri giggles with red cheeks.",
                "Is it just me, or is she more relaxed when it's just the two of us?",
                "Or maybe it's the excitement she feels from sharing something that she enjoys.",
                "Here's a marker, [player].",
                "You can write any characters you want.",
                "I'll help you once I finish cutting the ribbons.",
                "Ah, alright.",
                "Sitting on the floor together, the two of us get to work.",
                "I carefully draw a different character on each paper, doing my best to manage my bad handwriting.",
                "Yuri unravels a long strand of red ribbon to her desired length.",
                "Then, she reaches into her bag once more and pulls out a pocket knife.",
                "Eh...?",
                "The knife is strangely beautiful.",
                "The silver handle has an intricate pattern of waves etched into it.",
                "The blade itself is gently tinted blue.",
                "That's no ordinary pocket knife...",
                "It looks really fancy.",
                "A-Ah...",
                "Well...",
                "Embarrassed, Yuri looks away.",
                "What is it?",
                "You're going to think it's weird...",
                "Yuri, whatever it is, I have no reason to judge.",
                "To each their own, you know?",
                "If you promise you won't be weirded out...",
                "Yeah, I promise.",
                "Alright...",
                "The thing is, I'm kind of into knives...",
                "They're just...so pretty...",
                "I-I can't help it!",
                "I don't know what it is...",
                "The combination of craftsmanship and feeling of danger, maybe...",
                "Uu, what am I saying...?",
                "Please don't think I'm weird for this...",
                "Ahaha.",
                "You're laughing at me...",
                "No, I'm not laughing at you.",
                "It's just funny how nervous you got about sharing.",
                "It's...well, it's an interesting thing to be into, I guess.",
                "But I think it kind of suits you.",
                "Suits me...?",
                "Yeah... It's kind of intense. Ahaha.",
                "Besides, it's a really cool-looking knife, I can't deny that.",
                "It is, isn't it...?",
                "Yuri relaxes her expression once again.",
                "Would you like to hold it?",
                "Sure, I'll check it out.",
                "Yuri carefully hands me the knife, with the handle facing me.",
                "I take it and turn it around in my hands.",
                "It feels heavy, and extremely solid.",
                "Where do you even get a knife like this...?",
                "Curious of its sharpness, I feel the point of the knife with my index finger.",
                "Ow--!",
                "[player]--!!",
                "Why did you do that?!",
                "I didn't expect it to be that sharp...!",
                "I barely touched it at all.",
                "I-It's my fault!",
                "I should have warned you...",
                "This knife is extremely sharp...",
                "It can cut through skin like it's paper.",
                "Oh no...",
                "A small drop of blood trickles down the side of my finger.",
                "Yuri takes my hand and gives the wound a closer look.",
                "Ah...",
                "She stares at it and noticeably fidgets.",
                "If you're squeamish, I'll go wash it off now--",
                "A-Ah!",
                "Without warning, Yuri puts my finger in her mouth and licks the wound.",
                "I feel her tongue curl around my finger.",
                "Startled, I instinctively pull my hand back.",
                "O-Oh...",
                "P-Please forgive me!",
                "I wasn't thinking!",
                "I...",
                "Yuri lowers her head, her face burning up.",
                "Yuri...",
                "That's the most embarrassing thing I've ever done...",
                "How could I do something like that??",
                "I'm sorry, I'm sorry...",
                "Ah...",
                "Sure, it was a little weird, and it took me by surprise...",
                "But I guess she was just trying to help, right...?",
                "Yuri, I think you're overreacting a little...",
                "Uuuh...",
                "She doesn't lift her head.",
                "What if she doesn't recover from this for the rest of the afternoon?",
                "Alright, you know what...",
                "This might be a stupid thing to do, but I do it anyway.",
                "I take Yuri's hand and lick her index finger in return.",
                "[player]--!!",
                "D-Did you really just do that?",
                "N-Now we're even...",
                "...",
                "Yuri just looks at me like I did something wrong.",
                "Ahaha...",
                "I knew that would be a bad idea...",
                "If not for the sweet aroma of the Jasmine oil, the air would be extremely heavy right now.",
                "You're so weird, [player].",
                "Yuri giggles shyly.",
                "Eh...?",
                "Yuri calling <i>me</i> weird?",
                "I have no response to that...",
                "Where do you keep your bandages?",
                "Ah...",
                "I don't think I need one, actually.",
                "It was a tiny cut.",
                "Look, it already stopped bleeding.",
                "I see...",
                "That's relieving.",
                "The tension is quickly lifted.",
                "We each resume our respective activities.",
                "I watch Yuri's knife cut through the ribbon like it's nothing but air.",
                "Meanwhile, I continue to make progress on the paper.",
                "After we finish attaching the paper to the ribbons, we lay them all out side by side.",
                "It looks better than I expected and will be very effective as a door curtain.",
                "It looks great.",
                "Good thinking coming up with this, Yuri.",
                "Ah, thanks...",
                "It's just something I saw online, really.",
                "Are you ready to move onto the next task?",
                "Yeah, let's do it.",
                "What do you have in mind?",
                "I'd like to create a banner.",
                "That's why I asked you to buy the paint tablets.",
                "Ah, that's right.",
                "One of the items Yuri had asked me to buy was a kit of watercolor paint tablets.",
                "We'll need about six cups of water to put each of the tablets in.",
                "Do you mind fetching those for us?",
                "Of course not.",
                "Six cups of water...",
                "I'll be right back in a minute.",
                "Thank you very much.",
                "Oh, and just a little bit of water is okay.",
                "If you fill the cups too much, it will be too diluted.",
                "Taking Yuri's advice, I decide to use small plastic bathroom cups rather than full-sized glasses.",
                "I put them on a plate to catch any paint that drips, then bring it back into my room.",
                "Yuri?",
                "Yes?",
                "I come in to see Yuri quickly unrolling her sleeve, pulling it back over her arm.",
                "Ah, nothing...",
                "Your face is a little red.",
                "Is it too hot in here, or anything?",
                "Ah--",
                "No, not at all!",
                "There's nothing wrong, so...",
                "Let's mix the paint.",
                "Yuri hurriedly dismisses me and takes it upon herself to unwrap the tablets, dropping them into the cups.",
                "So...",
                "I thought we would do something simple that would look very nice.",
                "I'd like to paint a gradient across the banner...",
                "Starting with the colors for a sunrise, then daytime, then sunset and nighttime.",
                "Once it dries, I'll write an inspirational quote across the banner.",
                "We can hang it on the wall behind the podium at the front of the classroom.",
                "Ah, neat.",
                "What are you going to write?",
                "Well...",
                "...It will be more fun to surprise you.",
                "Yuri smiles at me.",
                "If you say so...",
                "After rolling out the banner, Yuri and I kneel on opposite sides so we don't get in the way of each other.",
                "Yuri uses a brush and adds a few dots of different colors across the banner to serve as a color guide when we paint.",
                "This kind of reminds me of elementary school...",
                "Painting on a banner with watercolors feels a lot like the art class projects we had back then.",
                "It's relaxing.",
                "Ah...",
                "I'm sorry if this feels too childish...!",
                "No, I didn't mean that at all.",
                "It's kind of fun, you know?",
                "...Yeah.",
                "It is fun.",
                "I'm glad you feel that way, too.",
                "Yuri stops painting for a moment, thinking to herself.",
                "For me...",
                "I don't need to go out and do crazy things to have fun.",
                "In fact, I usually don't even want to.",
                "I just like when I can spend time with one other person...",
                "Even if it's something simple, like reading - it doesn't even matter if we don't talk much.",
                "Just having a friend next to me makes things feel a little bit nicer.",
                "I think that's all it takes for me to be happy.",
                "Is that so...?",
                "Even if Yuri and I are quite different, I can understand where she's coming from.",
                "I feel that way about things like anime and games, where simply sharing the experience with someone can make me happy.",
                "I think I feel the same way.",
                "Yuri smiles gently.",

                "For waking up on time!",
                "Well, you've been doing that for a while now...",
                "Uh-huh!",
                "But you never even said anything about it!",
                "Even though we walk to school together every day...",

                "I always thought it was implied.",

                "A club?",
                "I told you already, I'm really not--",
                "I start to say what I always do - that I'm not interested in joining any clubs.",
                "But something tells me Sayori would take more offense to that now.",
                "After all, how could I tell her that clubs are a waste of time...",
                "...when she's starting a club of her very own?",
                "...Actually, yeah.",
                "I think I've decided on a club.",

                "I used to ask myself why I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl.",
                "But I started to realize that in a way, I envy her.",
                "When Sayori puts her mind to something, she can accomplish great things.",
                "So that's why I feel like I should do something special for her.",
                "The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it.",
                "After I pack up my things, I stand up, gathering my motivation.",

                "I recall the room number of the club from a flier I saw.",
                "I walk across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit.",

                "Huh.",
                "So you're the [player] that Sayori's always talking about?",
                "T-Thank you for stopping by!",
                "It's a pleasure to meet you, [player].",
                "We're the Literature Club.",

                "Huhu.",
                "What an appropriate day for that, isn't it?",
                "Yeah!",
                "After all, Natsuki decided to--",
                "Hey, don't ruin the surprise!",
                "Ehehe, sorry...",
                "Everyone sit down at the table, okay?",
                "How about I make some tea as well?",

                "Ehehe. Well, you know.",

                "Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face.",

                "I finally bite down.",
                "The icing is sweet and full of flavor - I wonder if she made it herself.",
                "This is really good.",

                "You keep a whole tea set in this classroom?",
                "Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission.",

                "Well... Ah...",
                "Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.",

                "My favorites are usually novels that build deep and complex fantasy worlds.",
                "The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me.",
                "And telling a good story in such a foreign world is equally impressive.",
                "Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.",
                "She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.",

                "But that just helps you get to know the characters!",
                "And besides, it's still entertaining.",

                "Whenever we talk about what the club is supposed to mean, I kept feeling like it was right for me to do.",
                "Especially after you've been trying so hard to express yourself, too.",
                "It just...made me feel like I could say it in confidence, and our friendship doesn't have to change.",
                "Ahaha.",
                "It's so silly...the club is only two people, but it already means this much to me.",
                "Monika feels a tightening sensation in her heart.",
                "A feeling of connection as Sayori's emotions radiate between them.",
                "Me too.",
                "I was...so lost until you showed up.",
                "You're so brave, Sayori. You're so strong and brave. I don't even compare.",
                "Monika steps forward.",
                "But...if nothing else, I can at least offer you some hug energy.",
                "If you'd like.",
                "Wordlessly, and without a smile, Sayori rests her forehead on Monika's shoulder.",
                "Through their contact, Monika can almost feel the torrent of thoughts swimming in Sayori's head.",
                "And in this moment, enchanted by the air of the club...",
                "Monika realizes that of all the days that have passed, this is the one where she really, really hopes that nobody new walks through the door.",
                "She speaks softly.",
                "You're like...the sweetest girl I've ever met.",
                "You can say anything. I'll never judge you.",
                "I promise.",
                "Sayori's breath begins to quiver.",
                "She takes several deep breaths, trying as hard as she can to start speaking, to say the things she never once dared to say out loud.",
                "Finally, she speaks in a choked voice.",
                "I'm...so worthless.",
                "I'm worthless and everyone would be better off without me.",
                "She suppresses a sob as a tear falls down her cheek.",
                "I'm just...an inconvenience to everyone.",
                "I'm not good at anything, and it just feels like everyone just has to put up with me, and I hate it. I hate it.",
                "The more Sayori speaks, the more she fails to control her voice, falling victim to the overwhelming sadness clutching at her throat and chest.",
                "I don't want to have these thoughts. I want them to go away. And now I'm making you put up with me and I just want to die!",
                "As soon as Sayori loses her composure, Monika becomes determined to keep her own.",
                "She only wants to be what Sayori needs right now.",
                "So, she won't let any sadness show.",
                "Her voice comes through as soft and gentle.",
                "This isn't putting up with you.",
                "It's just being your friend.",
                "Monika offers a few words of comfort.",
                "But she knows--Sayori said it herself--that the thoughts Sayori experiences are ones that don't belong.",
                "And Monika can't magically make them go away.",
                "The most she can do is help Sayori battle them, like any good friend would do.",
                "You have so much value.",
                "To me, and your other friends, too.",
                "This club wouldn't have been the same without you.",
                "I really, really mean that.",
                "You coming here was the best thing that could have happened.",
                "Even if we never got any other members...I would still be happy.",
                "That's what you brought here.",
                "You brought us a vision...and you also brought happiness.",
                "And that's your favorite thing to do...right?",
                "Sayori doesn't respond, but Monika feels her gently nod.",
                "No more words are needed between them.",
                "The two share their embrace for a while longer, Monika letting Sayori take as much time as she needs.",
                "Once her breathing steadies and her sniffles fully cease, Sayori lifts her head and wipes her eyes.",
                "I guess I needed that.",
                "Some days are harder than others.",
                "Well, I'm here whenever you need me.",
                "But any other time...I'll make sure that things are the way they usually are.",
                "If that's what makes you happy.",
                "Mhm.",
                "Thanks.",
                "You're the best.",
                "No, you are.",
                "The two exchange smiles.",
                "You know...I'm sorry to bring this up all of a sudden, but...have you considered talking to a professional?",
                "Sayori nods.",
                "It's scary.",
                "Since it's already so hard to tell people...",
                "Yeah.",
                "Well...of course it will always be your choice, but if you're ever looking to find the courage for it, I can do my best to help you.",
                "Thanks.",
                "I think it helps knowing that you would.",
                "Sayori suddenly yawns and stretches.",

                "And hungry...",
                "Ahaha.",

                "No, I want to!",
                "I mean...I can say that it's definitely one thing that makes me happy.",

                "All of a sudden, the sound of the door causes the two of them to turn their heads.",

                "Look... I know that you're kind of in a tough spot, and that it's hard for you to really express yourself.",
                "But you've really demonstrated to me that you're great at self-reflection, and critical thinking. Even if it doesn't feel like it to you.",

                "It was an unusual way for Natsuki to express her appreciation, but Monika knew what she meant.",

                "It took me several days just to come here because I was afraid that Monika told everyone how inconsiderate I was, but I decided that was probably irrational--",
                "Wait--",
                "No, that was totally my fault! I felt so bad about interrupting you that I just like, walked out...",

                "Well-- I was really nervous to come here for some other reasons, too.",

                "It's so hard to find others who are into the same things I am, except online.",
                "So I thought the Literature Club would provide a chance for me to do that.",

                "But for anything else...I just have no idea what to say.",
                "So...I understand that about myself. I'm just not good with people. I can't help it.",
                "So it feels like whenever I'm confronted with a new social situation, I'm either ignored, or made fun of...or taken pity on.",
                "And...Sayori falls into that third category.",
                "She...what? Hold on, you're saying that Sayori is taking pity on you?",

                "If you don't like me or you don't connect with my interests, then just tell me. I can accept that and move on.",
                "Sayori is...too nice to me.",
                "I'm so stupid for not realizing that she would just go along with whatever I pushed onto her.",

                "What kind of friendship has one person always trying to cater to the other person's weird needs?",

                "Neither person is to blame, but it's an issue that can't be resolved without them understanding each other better.",
                "Sayori wants to be your friend. I promise that.",

                "I think I'm so afraid of people pushing me away that I just push them away first.",

                "I know you said you have a hard time believing that, but I promise that it's true.",
                "...",
                "You don't have to be a social person for people to like you.",
                "I think...you're really considerate in your own way, you know? Worrying so much about people's feelings.",
                "We're all kinda weird. It's a literature club. Ahaha.",
                "But it's the best part that we're all different, and have different interests.",
                "Like, about the book...",
                "I'm reading it because I want to. I promise, that's what I really want.",
                "It's a bit of a struggle, but try not to mistake that for me not enjoying it.",
                "I mean, we could never discover new things if we didn't try them first, right?",
                "I want to learn the reasons that you love it so much.",

                "Already, the heavy atmosphere surrounding her seems to have evaporated through the caress of Sayori's arms.",
                "Your hair is so pretty.",

                "Mm...",

                "For once, she feels okay just listening, rather than worrying so much about saying the right thing.",
                "Sayori, sensing Yuri's comfort, lets her rest.",
                "It must be so difficult for her to feel relaxed around other people.",
                "But if the Literature Club can make it happen, then it's something that she deserves to experience.",
                "Well, then...",
                "Based on my understanding of your feelings, I suppose I wouldn't mind if we were to continue reading.",
                "Ehehe.",
                "That's what I wanted to hear.",
                "But...we can stop at any time.",

                "Of course.",
                "I'm not gonna judge anything this early on, though. So we'll just see what happens.",
                "Oh, and...",
                "Um...",
                "It's not good to touch people without their consent first...",
                "Oh no! I'm sorry!",
                "I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable!",

                "Well...you've been so patient with exploring my interests.",

                "This time around, instead of talking about the cherries, I just talked about my feelings, and Sayori didn't get defensive.",

                "How come you never told me?",
                "Because I'm past that point in my life, and I really prefer not to revisit it.",
                "I prefer more mature things now.",
                "Excuse me?",

                "Let's try to keep things subjective.",

                "It's hard when you're feeling hurt, but it never helps to just tell someone all the things that they're doing wrong.",
                "I think first you have to make sure that they know you're ready to respect them and listen to them, and admit the things that you feel you could do better.",

                "It made me think about...how a person's behavior isn't always just how they decide to be.",
                "It's also made up of their past experiences and their insecurities.",
                "I think...that helps me see other people as actual people, rather than as insignificant side characters who are out to get me somehow.",
                "Is that how you felt about Natsuki?",

                "But...in reality, everyone is always trying their best. And everyone wants to be happy.",
                "Monika peers over at Yuri's paper, but to her surprise, Yuri pulls it in closer, partially covering it with her arm.",
                "Ahaha, I have to be able to read it to help out, you know.",
                "It's okay.",
                "My thoughts are a lot more organized now, after being able to talk to you about it.",
                "Now that I'm actually putting it on paper, I realize I'd really prefer others not to read it.",
                "Yuri laughs softly to herself--a rare expression.",
                "I'm kind of glad to hear that, actually.",
                "I somehow keep finding ways to butt into this whole thing. I've done enough damage. Ahaha.",
                "But it's also been so wonderful talking about this. I mean, I always thought you were really smart, but...",
                "Yuri smiles.",
                "I will always be terrible at these things.",
                "People are just...so incomprehensible to me. I'll never get the hang of being one.",
                "Ahaha.",
                "But...listening to you so much has really helped me make sense of some things.",
                "So just...don't call it damage. Please.",
                "Monika gives Yuri a gentle smile.",
                "I can't believe I came to this club looking for fantasy geeks, and all I got was real friends who value me.",
                "Is that...a joke?",
                "Of course it is.",
                "Ahaha, I still can't tell with you!",

I think you're the only person that she'll listen to. I don't know why.  But please try to do something. Maybe you can convince her to talk to a therapist.  I've always wanted to try being better friends with Yuri, and it really hurts me to see  this happening. I know I'm going to hate myself later for admitting that, but right now  I don't care. I just feel so helpless. So please see if you can do something to help.  I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I'll make you cupcakes if I have to. Just please  try to do something.  As for Monika... I don't know why, but she's been really dismissive about this. It's like she just wants us  to ignore it. So I'm mad at her right now, and that's why I'm coming to you about this.  DON'T LET HER KNOW I WROTE THIS!!!! Just pretend like I gave you a really good poem, okay?  I'm counting on you. Thanks for reading.",

                "Thank you to everyone who worked so hard on the control simulation. I can't imagine how tedious it must have been to so delicately hide Monika's elevated permissions from her without disrupting our connection to the VM.\\n\\nJust to clarify - all of the recordings labeled \"Side Stories\" are part of the control simulation, right? I'm noticing some details of the characters' lives here and there that differ a little bit from those in VM1, even trivial ones. Is it part of the butterfly effect from some of Monika's more fundamental changes, or is it a result of her just messing around with the other characters in VM1 as her own experiment (or for fun)?\\n\\nSo if I'm keeping track, we have what, like 5 different universes in total? With 3 or 4 of them created and then destroyed by Monika, of course. It's funny because I keep wanting to speculate on which one is the \"real\" universe but in reality, they all are.

Could that be why the \"character\" has such limited and dissonant personality traits? Or am I reading too much into this?\\n\\nI'll open an issue to start tracking info and observations on the anomaly of this \"character\" appearing.",

That's the government's job to figure out, long after we've made enough headway for it to no longer apply to us.\\n\\nIt's fundamentally flawed to apply ethical reasoning to this anyway, because humanity's code of ethics is based upon nothing more than our knowledge and understanding of lifeforms similar to ourselves. We don't have ethics for killing bacteria or plants - only for the creatures that we can convincingly project our emotions onto. The \"humans\" in our VMs operate completely differently from us on a fundamental level, and therefore should not be taken any more seriously than a machine that's programmed to print \"I feel sad\".\\n\\nWe're engineers, not philosophers.",
                "Issues caused by unprotected memory",
                "Has anyone evaluated the side effects that might be caused by sharing a memory pool between multiple VMs, rather than allocating them separately? I'm looking at some of the files VM1 is generating, and I'm finding some information that *definitely* shouldn't be there. I haven't seen any evidence that this is actually affecting the inside of the VM itself, so I don't think this is a priority, but it's definitely worth noting.\\n\\nMy best guess is that memory being freed from VM2 isn't getting zeroed out, which technically gives VM1 access to it. All the info I have will go into the issue tracker, but I wanted to check if anyone else already noticed something along these lines.",
                "Binary data in VM2?",
                "I've made some new headway with VM2. Don't get too excited, it's still impossible to establish any kind of stable connection.\\n\\nBut it occurred to me that I could at least run a memory dump through some pattern analysis routines to see if we can decipher any digital data from their VM. I didn't want to hog all the server time on a hunch, but I have some preliminary results that indicate the presence of binary computer systems. Based on this, I'm going to schedule three days of server time next week to isolate any chunks of memory that appear to be binary data. If successful, we'll definitely be able to find some encoded text and get our first tiny glimpse of VM2.\\n\\nDon't mind me though, just keep going nuts on VM1 and hopefully I'll have more to share soon!",
                "Let's move on",
                "We need to have a meeting about shifting our focus a little bit. We've reset VM1 how many times now? For real, we've definitely collected as much data as we can from it at this point. We just need to work with what we have and try to increase the stability of our connection to VM2. We've obviously gotten spoiled by the ease of access that VM1 offers us, but it's just unrealistic for someone in real life to be granted a level of elevation even close to \"Monitor Kernel Access\". If we can't establish a stable connection to VM2, then how can we expect to get anywhere when the same scenario inevitably occurs to our own universe?\\n\\nAnyway - thanks to Ro's work, we were able to acquire a few rudimentary logs. I have an idea on how to increase connection stability to VM2 while maintaining weak hypervisor access to everyone inside on an individual basis. Ironically, it has to do with something that they're building in their own VM. I'll go into detail in a more formal report, but some of the log files indicate attempts of theirs to pool together the access potential of multiple individuals into a single parallel unit. It sounds ridiculous, but if they actually get somewhere with it, then we might have a solid entry point that doesn't heavily intrude upon the VM.\\n\\nI'm going to spin up a read-only hypervisor that we can use to test different ideas like this. The elevation level will be set to \"Monitor Adjacent Runtime-Level Access\". The VM will just be named \"TEST VM\" for now, although the parallel-access unit they're building in the VM seems to be called \"Project Libitina\", according to the few logs we have. We can change the name once we actually get a decent picture of it.",

We're all working our asses off with our jobs on the line, so we might as well have some fun with it too, right?\\n\\nI totally get why Paula wants to rush into data collection. But my proposal is to shift our efforts a little and build out some new features for making real-time connection to the VM more useful and fun. If we're basically simulating a miniature universe then it's kind of a waste to not be able to spend some quality time in there, right???\\n\\nBut actually...I think wrapping this whole thing in the guise of a video game is a great (and hilarious!) way of covering our tracks. And if we do a good enough job, we might even be able to present it to Paula as a useful endeavor.\\n\\nKey selling points:\\n* 5 to 6 hours of misery, dread, and cute girls\\n* Learn, through the existential crises of others, how to cope with your own simulated universe\\n* Witness the destruction of a universe over and over, in video game form\\n\\nHAHAHA! This is going to be absolutely amazing.\\n\\nAnd no, the irony isn't lost on me...creating a secret team within a secret team is more meta than I signed up for, and that's saying something considering we literally work for Metaverse Enterprise Solutions.\\n\\nWe can come up with a fake game studio name and everything too...obviously NO plans to go public with this, but it would be a good part of the whole disguise. Plus, I want a cool team name that makes us feel like a bunch of heroes for saving the universe...kidding, but we're at least saving our jobs. Something like Team Salvation?",

My gratitude for you is higher-reaching than the mountains I'm gonna live in after faking my death. ;p (throwback to you ACTUALLY entertaining that plan after helping me break up with Daphne...to this day I can never tell how serious or joking you are about things...or life in general...but I think I would literally implode if I didn't have you to remind me that things never matter as much as they seem in the moment, and that things will always be okay.)\\n\\nImagine if we really do end up working together at Metaverse...that's literally the only way I think I'd be capable of coping with a mundane desk job. I know you said that your referral of me won't go very far because you're not a senior engineer, but...as I'm coming out of my rough patch, it's the future I imagine for myself every day.\\n\\nI'm sorry for always being such a bundle of stress. I always feel like I want to be doing more for you, because the amount you do for me just seems like more than anything I could give back. You inspire me to always improve. And when I don't believe in myself, I stay motivated to become a better person so that I can deliver all of my best qualities to you.\\n\\nI love you and I always will, until we face the end of the world together. Wishing for another 14 million years of friendship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith everlasting love,\\nPaula",
